# Task 3 Reflection 

## 
My first look at this assignment caught me off guard completly. We were introducted to something 
that I personally have never messed with so I was worried about how I was going to do this assignment. At 
first I thought we were going to discuss more about it, but that ended up not being the case. This worried
me and took me awhile to wrap my head around the purpose of doing so. The task at hand seemed like one 
I would not end up finishing, because there was so much uncertainty I had about it. 
    As time went on I ran into more and more issues, some were minor and some were a lot more complex. Starting with minor
issues, one invovled the first task. It seemed easy because we went over it prefiely but I found out
that it was not and took some research to complete it. It had me researching certain vocab such as 
branches, forks, and repository itself. Onto more complex ideas like the second task. This task to me 
was one of the harded ones because there was so many questions that needed to be answered in order to
finish it. The first thing was to just understand what the question was asking, what the some of the 
words meant, and how do I go about it. After doing this process I started my research so I can
answer all of these questions and once I had them all answered that is when I started to do 
the task. Within hours of time and research I ended up figuring it out. 
    My advice for future students is getting a group together with other students because 
some of the other students might have knowledge that they can give you about the assignment. 
Another thing I recommend is using the teacher a lot more than what I did. It will make
the process a lot easier than it was for me, but that being said I got a lot more out of it
when solving the issue mostly by myself. This is not something that is easy to grasp so you
need to practice and keep practicing. 
    The most difficult aspect for this assignment is task number two because of all the 
the knowledge we are missing. My recomandation would be to go over simple things of github
and vocab so we have somehwere to start.
