# PA2 Reflection - Candace Moore

* There were several struggles that I had to overcome while complete this week's homework assignment. 
I know that confidence has little to do with programming itself, but I felt scared because I had an 
expectation of what I should have already known. Thankfully, I save my class notes from Sharon's CS111
class and that helped me tremendoulsy. I struggled with the sytax in term of getting the formatting to 
line up for the first few lines that we needed to cout. 

* For the most part, I was able to complete the assignment by myself. I asked one of my classmates, when 
I was having trouble with one of the lines, and I'm so thankful that I'm in class with peers that encourage
me to learn, patient when I need time to think, and don't just give me the answer!

* If I had to give advice to other students, I would suggest they start early. I had classmates that
I had CS111 with, and I felt like they didn't start until today, and they seemed to forget the basics
of planning. I'm working really hard to approach these problems with the similar best practices I was 
introduced to in the previous class. This helped elevate my confidence, especially when I was stuck. 

* I had so much fun with this assignment because the challenge, and incremental progression and success made it more exciting and motivating to keep going. I realized while I do not posses the level of understanding I would like, the homework, and periodic checkins with continued support makes me excited to see what comes next, and how this project will develop over time. 

* The most difficult part of this assignment was the design process, and making sure I wrote exactly what I was trying to accomplish on paper, and break it down step by step. My brain tends to get over stimuated to where I'm counter productive. Because I'm aware of this issue that I have, I really try to take proactive steps to make sure I'm setting myself up for success.
