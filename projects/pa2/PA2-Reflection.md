PA 2 - Reflection

I enjoyed this assignment a lot because it was a mix of review and reteaching
myself how to think like a programmer. Even though we are already on week four of 
the school year, I find myself still in summer mode. So, when doing this
assignment, I found it hard to concentrate on the task. My mind would easily 
wonder, and it would take me awhile to come up with a possible solution. However,
the steps to achieve a running program were still fun, and I enjoyed all the time
it took in order to make it work.

The most challenging aspect of this assignment was relearning how to use the 
getline and while functions. Last year, we briefly learned how to use getline in 
a while loop to read and write to and from a file. While it is relatively simple, 
applying it to a program and making sure it shows what you want are challenging. 
Then there was also the fact that I never ask for help. I like to do things
independently, which was great for CS 111 because the instructions were very 
detailed for each assignment to where it would be hard not to accomplish it. 
However, in CS 112, it is a lot more independent study with class time focused 
on messing around with what we were supposed to have read for the homework. 
This is new for me because I like being told exactly what to do, but in this 
assignment, it was a free for all. If what you wrote made the program work then
that's great, but it could be completely different from what your classmate wrote.
I think this is the most chalenging aspect of not only this assignment, but also 
this class. Without the direction I was used to in CS 111, I am intimidated to 
try writing the program of my own creative thinking. Although, I am excited about
this method of teaching as well because thise is how the real-world works, no one
will tell me exactly what they want. I will have to use trial and error for
every program because I will not get it write the first time. 

Overall, I enjoyed this assignment because it made me think for myself and ask for
help. If it hadn't been for the check-in on thursdays class, I would have been 
very frustrated at my lack of being able to complete the assignment by myself. I 
would have went to the tutoring available, although I would have been very 
reluctant becuase I dislike asking for help when I believe I shouldbe able to 
accomplish it myself.
