# CS 112 PA #1
In this assignment, you will practice your git / github skills by performing
the following tasks:

1. Merge the changes from the master CS 112 repository into your local repository
2. Create a merge conflict that you must resolve.  Check out two copies of your
repository.  On the first folder, rename "conflict_a.md" to "conflict.md"; commit
and push the change.  On the second folder, rename "conflict_b.md" to "conflict.md";
commit and attempt to push the change.  This should create a merge conflict that
you will then have to successfully resolve.  Commit and push the merged "conflict.md"
file to your repository.
3. Add your reflection to this folder.  See 
[my reflection template](../../docs/sample_reflection.md)
