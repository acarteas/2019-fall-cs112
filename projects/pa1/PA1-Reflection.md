# PA 1 - Reflection

This first assignment was difficult because I did not understand how
to use github. We only went over it once in the lab, and while 
I understood it then, when I went to complete it, I had lost
all my prior understanding because I did not practice with it.
I ended up going to office hours in order to learn how to 
navigate github. The main problem I had was merging my repository 
with the class one, so that I could commit and push all my work. 
Once I got help from my professor, it went by faster and I was able 
to finally complete my assignment.

If I could change one thing about this assignment it would be to 
have bit more direction. The assignment itself was simple once 
you understood how to complete it. There doesn't need to be more 
class time on it persay, but maybe a more step by step process 
would help future students learn easier (at least for this 
particular assignment).

This first week has been a bit of an eye opener for me. My first CS 
class had a more step by step process in learning C++, which I 
enjoyed because I learn faster when I am showed how to do it first. 
However, this class is a lot more independent study and 
application. I have to read more and figure code out my own style 
of coding, in order to complete programs. Which makes more sense 
because in the real world, people are not going to know exactly 
what they want, I am going to have to create programs with vague 
ideas that people have. I am going to need to put in a lot more 
hours for this class than I normally would for my usual classes.

Overall, the first week and assignment of CS 112 was a success. 
While I might not be as knowledgeable in C++ as some of the other 
students in this class, I can definitely study to catch up and 
surpass them. I know what I need to review in order to participate 
during class, and I know what to practice in order to succeed in 
this class.
