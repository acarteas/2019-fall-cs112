#pa3 Reflection
This assignment in comparison to the previous one was a lot harder, which I assume was intended. Like most the hardest thing I faced was figuring out how to change 
the file we were given. Other then that the file i/o was realively easier to do, because it is something I have learned from my previous cs class. The reason behind 
the struggle of this assignment is due to the minipulation of the file. It did not make sense to me on how to do it so It took me even longer to try and complete it,
because I would get wrapped into all of these different ideas I had which eventaully lead me the wrong way. The good thing about this assignment was understanding 
the complexity of it even though it seemed easy. I remember when some of the students were talking about it they discussed how easy it sounded, but as the week went on
the ended up not being the case. Most of us ran into the same issue, and tried to get together and figure it out , but we were all missing the main understanding 
of file minipulation. In terms of what to do with this assignment in the future is to do a recap of key concepts. For example going over it in lab or lecture tuesday. 
I found it difficult to fix up my code the day before the due date, because it made me run into other syntax issues. I also enjoyed the challenge, because it forced me 
to get out of my comfortzone and collabed with fellow students. This assignment also forced me to learn some things about github, because I had to use some of the code
given by our profesor. Overall I enjoyed the assignment and wish I had more time to work on it to make not only fix my code, but make it better for future use. Doing 
this assignment refreshed my mind, and forced me to think more because of all the issue I kept running into. That being said I am not fully confident in my code, and plan
on returning to it to fix it and make it properly.
