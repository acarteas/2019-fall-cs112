## Reflection for pa_3 
This was a very valuable assignment and I appreciate the opportunity to cbuild on previous code that we have written. I'm already thinking about ways to refactor the code so that more functions that modify the image can be written. I like the way my code looks as well, clean. I had to employ the help of a friend to get me beyond the hump though. I was getting caught up in modifying the file and couldnt figure out how to split the individual rows of the vector, but my friend showed me some functionality of a class of objects that made it way more simple and reduced my code by about 10 lines. Like usual I was thinking that it was more complicated than it actually needed to be. I get lost in the documentation of C++ because there is a lot of terminology that is packed into each definition but im getting better at recognizing the language. this assignment has brought me a few steps closer to knowing a tiny smidge about C++. I regret that I didnt allocate enough time for it but I had alot of other things due last week and work on the weekends.. there is just not enough time in the day.
