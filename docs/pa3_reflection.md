# Reflection pa3

*  This assignment from the start presented struggles. I couldn't get my existing code to work in
a new project because I added the ppm file incorrectly. I made the mistake of associating the resource
file (ppm) with a relative path. I need to create the file directly in Visual Stuio with in my project--huge learning! As the assignment progressed, and I actually started to make progress, but I found
that it was tough because I was trying to do too much in one function. 

* I was really excited for my first success which was to get the file to read, and I had a great
success getting the first line of data to be manipulated. I thought I was all set, and once I looked
closer at the output file, I noticed that the indicies became off as I was using .pushback. This has created enourmous stress because I was left with less time than I had wanted to do the second round
of troubleshooting. I have still yet to get the file to successfully manipulate every line. 
My indices are being thrown off by the fact that when I troubleshoot, and put a breakpoint, 
it is showing me that my first vaules of the second data line and the rest of the lines. 

* This really has me thinking about exception handeling and if we were reading bigger files, how
would we mitigate the chance of the indicies being off. 

* I would reccommend to other classmates to start early, do a pseduo sketch, but the biggest factor that really helped me was the coloaborative aspect. I got more out of working with Kirysten and talking through the what-if scenario because we were able to go over each other's logic, and I found there were areas that she had a much better understanding, and she was able to give me her breakdown.

* We have agreed to try to meet up every Monday, so we can have a chance to start early, identify any potnetnial issues, and that way we have the discord to facilitate the logic, and help mitigate my issue with confidence.
