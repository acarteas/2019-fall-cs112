# PA #2 Reflection - Vanja Venezia

This reflection might be brief as I completed the programming portion in about 25 minutes once I got going. I originally was overthinking the process, I wanted to have a series of conditional loops checking each input. This however, is unnecessary because image files always have consistent headers (with some small amount of wiggle room re:comments), but for basic funtionality it made since to assume that things would be in order. With that settled, it seemed like the simplest way to go about it was a series of ifstream input operators (>>) and a while (input good) loop for the data portion. My initial implementation of this concept worked and that is what I showed you in lab. The program remains the same. I am still toying with the idea of implementing comment sorting functionality early but don't know if I have the time. Either way, this was a fun and satisfying project as I absolutely love solving what seems like a complicated issue with elegant and minimal code.
