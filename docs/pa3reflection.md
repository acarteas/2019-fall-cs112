PA3 was not particularly difficult for me, I wrote all of it in class, but it did provide some interesting more emergent struggles that I believe are even better training for the "real world" than struggling against the code itself. The most trouble I had was deciding whether or not to write and implement a pixels class, as well as integrate the ppmdocument class written during lecture and function-away all of my main. IE deadlines vs optimization: trying to balance other time priorities from other classes or obligatons outside of school with the want to implement a more expandable code base. I figured that I'd gotten far enough with the code in the rudimentary path I was on that it would be a better use of my time to finish that up and then start optimizing and reformatting things on this next homework cycle. Time management, patching, and version update scheduling are all valuable practice for a modern dev or webmaster position.

I am quite enjoying this process and am looking forward to further feature implementation in this program. PPM seems like a good format to use for this process. It would be fun to try and add bitmap support at some point. I feel like after this semester is over and this program is mostly "finished", if it had bmp support, it wouldn't be too difficult to add a few features and build it into a datamoshing/databending program for glitch art. It almost seems like, to that end, it would be better to eventually take out the pixels class and handle the data a bit less elegantly to be able to affect rgb levels in weirder patterns more simply. Regardless, overall this project was comfortable and enjoyable while still feeling like solid practice.
